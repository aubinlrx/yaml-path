          don't start right away upon completion of this one.
        help_2: You can specify a <strong>trailing distance</strong> to specify that
          the due date of this checkpoint is dependent on the start of its children.
          This constraint needs the checkpoint to be 'floating' and may not be respected
          in some cases (delay, checkpoint's parents, etc.).
